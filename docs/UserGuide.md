## Introduction

Restaurant Daily Report is a CLI app that generates a whitepaper, 
summarizing the internals of a restaurant. Itâ€™s aim is to provide 
restaurant owners a quick overview of how their restaurant is performing 
daily so that restaurant owners can better manage their business operations.

As such, the daily report will include these categories:
* Menu: Information on all menu items
* Reservation: Information on number of reservations a day
* Stock: Information on all food items/quantities/prices
