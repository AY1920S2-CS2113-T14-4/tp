* **Enhancement added**
**Add**:
1. Basic add functionality.
2. Informs user if the user enters a name that is similar to the existing ingredients in the stock.
3. Allows flexibility in the ordering of the parameters specified from the user.
    + For example: `add stock; i/tomato; q/10; p/1.00;` and `add stock; i/tomato; p/1.00; q/10;` are both acceptable.
4. Customizes error messages according to the input supplied from the user.
    For example: 
    + `add stock; i/;` will display the message: `"The user's input must specify the ingredient's name!"`
    + `add stock; i/tomato; q/-10; p/1.00;` will display the message: `"Please enter a positive value for the quantity to be added!"`

5. Displays a reminder to the user if the user input a similar ingredient name that exists in the stock. This is inform the user if he/she has made a typo that was undesired.
    For example:
    + `add stock; i/ToMATo; q/10; p/1.00;` will display the following result, if tomato already exists in the stock:

    </p>    

**Delete**:
1. Basic delete functionality.
2. Allows flexibility in the ordering of the parameters specified from the user.
    + For example: `delete stock; i/tomato; q/10;` and `delete stock; i/tomato;` are both acceptable.
3. Allows the user to delete the ingredient by quantity count or remove from the stock entirely.
    For example:

    + `delete stock; i/tomato; q/1;` reduces the quantity of tomatoes in the stock by 1. 
4. Customizes error messages according to the input supplied from the user.
